### Just a Black Jack AI

Just for a bit of fun, and having heard about the the MIT BlackJack team years back, I decided to build this little AI and see exactly how the odds and strategy play out.

It turns out, the more games you play, the better - but I'm talking 1000's.

Just for kicks, I'd like to see if I can add some machine learning and enable it to develop it's own strategy.

Welcoming contributions!
